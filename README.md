# 🔐 Encryption and Decryption (Python)

A simple Python script that performs basic text encryption and decryption. This project demonstrates foundational cryptographic concepts, user input handling, and string manipulation in Python. It was developed as part of my progression into practical scripting and security‑oriented tasks.

---

## ✨ Features

* Encrypts plain text input from the user
* Decrypts encrypted text back to the original message
* Simple and interactive command line interface
* Demonstrates basic techniques in encryption and decryption

---

## 🛠 Requirements

* Python 3.x
* No external libraries required, uses only built‑in Python modules

---

## 🚀 How to Start

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kashbyte/encryption-decryption.git
```

2. Navigate to the project folder:

```bash
cd encryption-decryption
```

3. Run the script:

```bash
python encryption_decryption.py
```

---

## ▶️ How to Use

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt
2. Follow the on‑screen instructions to perform encryption
3. The encrypted output will be displayed
4. You can then use the decryption option to convert the encrypted text back to the original message

This tool is intended as an educational example showing how basic encryption algorithms can be implemented and reversed.

## 📚 What This Project Teaches

* Handling user input from the terminal
* Transforming strings for encryption and decryption
* Writing clear procedural Python code
* Fundamentals of simple encryption logic

---

## 💡 Possible Improvements

* Add support for stronger algorithms using standard libraries (e.g., AES, RSA)
* Implement key generation and secure key handling
* Add input validation and error handling
* Provide a graphical interface or web frontend

## 🧠 Notes

This project reflects an early step into security‑related programming. It helped me understand how data can be transformed and restored, and laid the groundwork for further exploration into secure coding practices and encryption standards.

Happy coding 🚀
